who am i?
  // the primary maintainer of Esri Leaflet, so you're in the right place!

what is Leaflet?
  > the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps
  OSS, small, mature, beginner friendly*, incredibly popular

designed for web developers, not geographers
   example: YX not XY to set the center of the map

how small?
  38KB! (about the size of a basemap tile  http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Topo_Map/MapServer/tile/12/1581/657 )

how small?
  so small you're on your own if you want to fetch a GeoJSON file

so does that mean that if leaflet doesn't have what i want i'm on my own??
  no! leaflet plugins to the rescue.

example plugins

thats where we come in
  Esri Leaflet
  not a replacement, an extension
  makes working with the most popular ArcGIS services a pleasure

goals:
  provide sensible defaults
  don't expose a lot of complexity

Lets take a tour:

TileLayer
  subdomains
  static attribution
  you have to know the tile structure

  code sample:
  <link>
  <script>

  map and TileLayer

basemapLayer
  one liner with keyword
  dynamic attribution
  inherits TileLayer properties and methods

  code sample:
  <link>
  <script>
  <script>
  map and esri.basemapLayer
  leaflet method or constructor option

Marker, LatLng

Polyline, Polygon, Rectangle: FeatureGroup

GeoJSON

what is GeoJSON?
geojson and geoservices json side by side
is there going to be a quiz?  no! we handle it for you

esri.FeatureLayer
  one liner demo
    fires gridded spatial queries to grab only a subset of whats in the database
  where filter, custom icon and popup
    exposes opportunity to customize using standard leaflet conventions
    you can access GeoJSON whether or not ArcGIS Server supports it

esri.dynamicMapLayer

  one liner demo
    get image from ArcGIS Server
    attribution updated automatically
  layers, definitionExpression, bindPopup

imageMapLayer with rasterFunction applied

we have plugins too!
  Renderer
  geocoder
the community has written some too
  Webmaps
  StreamLayer
  Legend

a group effort
  open source
  community supported
  no roadmap, no product lifecycle
  over 50 contributors (~dozen Esri staff)

  contributions from
  USGS, State Dept, Netflix, Stanford University, City of Philadelphia, Utah AGRC

  apps from
Stanford University, Forest Service, Ride Amigos, Mapillary, Storymaps team...

reasons some folks like esri leaflet

reasons why you'd choose the JSAPI
