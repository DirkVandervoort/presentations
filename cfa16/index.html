      <!--brief intros
my name is john gravois.  i do developer outreach for a little company called Esri in southern california.

I've been lucky to work with Vyki off and on for several years at various public civic tech events and we thought it would be fun to do a talk together and give our different 'partial outsider' perspectives on the evolution thats taking place in Los Angeles and other neighboring communities in service delivery and transparency.

<!-- anecdote about open data, i've been working at Esri for awhile now, but 10 years ago i lived in Sacramento making maps for an Environmental consulting company.  we had projects all over the central valley so as a one kid GIS department (fresh out of school, from a craigslist ad) i got intimately familiar with the different process to request shapefiles from various agencies.

sometimes they had an FTP
sometimes you had to tell them who you were
sometimes you had to pay them a little money
sometimes they wanted a LOT of money
once i even had to pedal my bike down and pick up a disc in person because the 2' lidar contour lines just wouldn't fit through the pipe between their office and mine

i *know* im rambling, but the point im getting at is this:

beyond making up the bulk of useful open data, GIS folk have been doing it for awhile now.

its an evolution. and today we want to talk about TWO crucial aspects of necessary change.

    <h2>we still need to improve <br><span style="color: #F1F540;">intra-</span>agency communication</h2>
  </section>

<!--
this can make a tremendous impact.
  avoid duplication of effort
  make sure folks know about resources that are available to them
  team up to share burden
  collaborate on procurement

<!--
2. when it comes to sharing data publicly, we still need to broaden the conversation to include a wider array of citizens.

because roughneck environmental consultants like me riding around on bikes looking for contour lines isn't really a utopian vision of civic transparency and technology fueled participatory democracy

vyki and i both adamently agreed that we wanted to do a talk about the 'how' and not the 'why' so we humbly give you 'A Case Study'.

  <h2>the pothole mayor</h2>
</section>

<!-- Disclaimer: Eric Garcetti was able to sum this up in a recent interview a lot more succintly than i could.  He said, "People were afraid to open up the data because they were afraid it was going to be used against them.  And you know what?  it **was** used against them!  The LA Times reported that there was a discrepancy in the amount of time households had to wait for large waste pickups.  And we had to own that and see it as an opportunity to improve the way we operate."

  <h2>disparate GIS > <br>Open Data > <br>GeoHub</h2>
</section>

<!--
Flashy web pages are great, but this represents a lot of work by a lot of folks to incrementally change the way the city operates. The vision came from mayor Eric Garcetti.

Before the project started, LA was 'unranked' when it came to open data. now they're number #1.

i see nerd spidey sense going off all over the place in here. some of you are thinking, 'by what methodology did you arrive at that tidy conclusion?'

  <h2>beating FUD</h2>
</section>

<!--
to combat fear, uncertainty and doubt, you need to reduce the friction to change.

This is where Esri puts a lot of effort.  One, we believe that anyone that uses our desktop software should be able to spin up an Open Data site for free, so we made sure the capability is there, right out of the box.

<section class="slide">
  <h2>open data with a <span style="color: #F1F540;">purpose</span></h2>
</section>

<!--
We need to move beyond throwing indigestible data over a wall and checking a box to giving the enterprise actual purpose.

campaigns / initiatives help us define our values and represent our collective identity

we need storytellers to jump into the firehose and come out sharing their insight.  (using open data we can fact check other people's conclusions)

Example: Vision Zero

<!--
show and tell:
open source templates that anyone can share
samples to embed open data in any webpage
easy charts from spatial data

'off the shelf'
enabling discussions regarding individual datasets
smart templates - map a relevant dataset's attributes once, other templates are ready to go too
make styling happen automagically

open source developers can build these tools too!
