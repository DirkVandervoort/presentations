how can we help GIS folks identify?

variables pointing at something else - red exclamation points in .MXDs
strings, integers, booleans - datatypes for feature class attribute columns
conditional operators = field calculator / definition expressions

functions accepting arguments - gp tools with input parameters
asynchronous = background geoprocessing

project dependencies - ArcMap license level? (yuck)
dev Environment
  ArcMap
  ArcCatalog
  online documentation
  
opinions - GIS folks definitely know about those
 which projection is the best?
 back in the day
